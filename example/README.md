`base64.js` Demonstrated how to encode SDB Base64 data and compares output to minified JSON representing the same information.
`base64.js` Demonstrated how to encode SDB Base85 / Ascii85 data and compares output to minified JSON representing the same information.
`tinySDB.js` Compares a tiny SDB entity in minified JSON against its Base85 and Base64 encodings.
`syncAsyncPipe.js` Demonstrates the various asynchronous and synchronous ways that encoding and decoding can be done and shows how processing pipes are added to alter data during encoding or decoding.
`cryptoSDB.js` Demonstrates the use of processing pipes to encrypt JavaScript SDB data using AES-256 in CBC mode, output it as Base85 encoded data, then reverse the process to produce a native JavaScript SDB object again.
